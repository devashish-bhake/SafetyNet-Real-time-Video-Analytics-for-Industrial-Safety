# SafetyNet. - Real Time Video Analytics for Industrial Safety
Industrial Safety is essential for promoting worker safety, preventing accidents, ensuring compliance, and enhancing overall operational efficiency in industrial environments. This project aims to develop a real-time video analytics tool that enhances industrial safety by detecting and preventing potential hazards and unsafe situations in industrial environments.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to leverage Deep Learning techniques to monitor live video feeds and provide real-time hazard detection, prompt alerts, and interventions, enhancing industrial safety and preventing accidents in industrial environments.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8
- Flask (for web interface)
- React

## Features

- Real-time video analysis for hazard detection.
- Proactive alert system for immediate intervention.
- User-friendly web interface for monitoring and control.
- Integration with existing industrial video data.
- Dashboard for factory managers to track safety statistics and incidents.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/smartinternz02/SBSPS-Challenge-10024-SafeZone-Real-time-Video-Analytics-for-Industrial-Safety)https://github.com/smartinternz02/SBSPS-Challenge-10024-SafeZone-Real-time-Video-Analytics-for-Industrial-Safety)
   cd SBSPS-Challenge-10024-SafeZone-Real-time-Video-Analytics-for-Industrial-Safety
2.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
     python app.py
   
5. Run web application:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
## Usage
- Upload industrial video data for analysis.
- The system will analyze the video in real-time, detecting potential hazards.
- The dashboard provides real-time statistics on safety incidents.
- When a hazard is detected, the system triggers alerts and interventions as needed.
